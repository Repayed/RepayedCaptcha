A simple captcha plugin that opens a gui on player join which they have to complete before accessing the server.

This version should be completely functional, however, there are a few key features which I'd like to add.

I'm very proud of this project because it's one of those projects that has actually taken me a pretty
long amount of time due to all the refactoring of code and all that. And I have still managed
to somehow push through and be close to finishing it. Note that the code is not flawless, but I'm
trying my best to actually make it good.

Like mentioned before, I still have a few more things I'd like to add, like a configuration so it's not hardcoded.
But I'm pushing it here so if anythning happens to my computer or anything I don't lose hours of work.

Ideally I'll be releasing this in the future for free and hopefully it helps some servers out.

Feel free to send me a message if you find any flaws in the code (I'm already aware of a few, which I'll
be fixing in the next couple of days but, I'll take any criticsm given into mind) :)!
